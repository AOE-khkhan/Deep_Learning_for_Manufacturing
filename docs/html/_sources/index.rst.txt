Deep Learning for Manufacturing (dlmfg): Documentation
===========================================================

Framework
----------------
The research aims to develop artificial intelligence based solutions by integrating multi-fidelity Computer Aided Emulation (CAE) and system data to enable process design, process monitoring, automated root cause analysis, automated correction in various phases of the manufacturing production cycle with the final aim of achieving **Closed Loop In-Process Quality Control** for Multi-Stage Manufacturing Systems.
